            <p class="about-hobby">My favorite hobbies that I enjoying doing is playing video games, hanging out with friends, and playing basketball. If I had to choose which one my favorite is I would say playing video games because I get the opportunity to hang out and spend quality time with my friends. 
			I get to teaming up with my friends to play a competitive game which provides a fun and interactive way for us to bond with one another. 
			It’s a great way for me to relax, challenge myself, and share exciting moment. Plus, the variety of games ensures there’s always something new and exciting for us to play.</p>
